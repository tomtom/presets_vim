*presets.txt*     Presets -- Quickly switch between vim configurations


This plugins allows users to push presets (sets of |options|) onto a 
configuration stack and remove them later on, i.e., it allows users to 
quickly switch between pre-defined configurations (e.g. GUI-related 
options).

In order to push a preset, use the |:Preset| command:

    :Preset! NAME
